📅️ September 2019 🍂🥮


--> An intro to DPDK for mortals
	3 Virtual Machines in Virtualbox. One of them is a proxy stealing packets that are sent between the othe 2 VM's.
	Network interfaces configuration through /etc/network/interfaces file.
	SSH to these machines through linux terminal.
	3 network interfaces in each machine. One using NAT, one using host-only adapter so i can SSH to these machines from host and one 	  more with internal network that is used for the communication of the 3 VM's.
	Installation of OpenvSwitch and creating vnet's for the 3 VM's.
	Creating a switch and configuring it's flows so it can be "evil" (forward packets to proxy).
	Trying to connect the 3 VM's when they belong to different subnet using a virtual router (not succeded).

--> OpenvSwitch
	Understanding OVS principles and functionality.

--> Hackfest
	Getting familiar with OSM.
	Getting familiar with Ubuntu.


	
📅️ October 2019 🍊🎃


--> Mininet
	Getting familiar with Software Defined Networks (SDN) using mininet.
	Writing some shell scripts in Python to "play" with Mininet.
	Implementing various topologies.
	Using different SND controller (POX, OpenDaylight).

--> Kubernetes
	Getting started with Minikube.
	Watching online courses.
	--> EDX Kubernetes Course
	Getting a bit familiar with containers.

	
 
📅️ November 2019 🍸🔥


--> Kubernetes
	Still watching courses.

--> Docker
	Installing Docker.
	Getting familiar with Docker and containers.
	Creating scripts that create a container and a bridge in each host.

--> Tunnels
	Getting started with network tunneling (GRE, VxLAN, Geneve, IpSec, GREoIpSec).
	Connecting Virtual Machines using tunnels.
	Connecting containers (of different hosts) using tunnels.
	Trying to open a new interface in each container (so i do not have to use docker0) using pipework (not succeded).
	Making a new docker network in each host and assigning containers to these networks. So each container gets a new interface that 
	has an IP of that network. So docker0 is not being used anymore.
	✴️ Did not succeed in using IpSec!



📅️ December 2019 🎄🎅

	Installing virt-manager.
	Making KVM VM's.
	Connecting KVM VM's using tunnels.
	Connecting containers in the KVM VM's using tunnels.

--> Openstack
	Installing Devstack in a VM.
	Getting familiar with Openstack.
	Creating VM's, volumes, networks, uploading images.
	✴️ Did not familiarize with Security!
